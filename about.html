  <h4>I'm a second year in the computer programming and analysis program at Seneca College</h4>
  <p>
    I enjoy debugging and figuring out complex problems like a puzzle when coding. The skills that I have acquired 
    during this program is learning the languages of Javacript, HTML and CSS. 
  </p>
  <p>The reason why I chose this game as the topic for my website is because it is a classic Canadian boardgame that
    everyone has played before in their childhood. Personally, it holds a lot of sentimental meaning for me as it was
    my favorite boardgame to play when I was young and even now it continues to hold a lot of joy for me. It is a game
    that I believe can withstand the test of time and can still be played regardless of the age since it is a very
    engaging game that is never dull.
