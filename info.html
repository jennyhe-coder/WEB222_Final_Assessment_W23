  <h2>History of the Game</h2>
  <p>Sorry! is a boardgame that has a very deep-rooted and interesting history that was first inspired by the ancient 
    Indian cross and circle game called "Pachisi". The earliest known version of the game was first created by 
    William Henry Storey of England that first patented the game in 1929 which was then adopted by Hasbro Corporation.
    Presently, the boardgame has gone through many different versions and editions all over the world, however it
    is still a well-received and popular game enjoyed by all different ages.

  <h2>Rules of the Game</h2>
  <p>The game is played with 2-4 players with each player picking a pawn color of their choice and placing them in 
    their own designated start area. The objective of the game is to be the first player to get all of their pawns 
    from the start to home area on the board. To start with each player must draw one card from the deck in the 
    center of the board and follow the instructions displayed on the card. This can range from a various set of 
    instructions such as move backward 4 spaces or move forward 5 spaces. It is is important to note that
    pawns can jump over any other pawn, however two pawn's cannot occupy the same space. If an opponent's pawn lands 
    on the same space as another opponents then they are able to bump that pawn back to their start space. If it is 
    the player's own pawn then it would result in the player losing their turn and the player's pawn remaining in
    the same place.

  <h2>Best Tips and Strategies for Winning</h2>
  <p>Here are some helpful tips to help you to win:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Pay attention to the position of your opponent's pawns and keep track of the cards played</li>
    <li>Try to get your pawns into your respective "safety zone" as quick as possible as pawns that are inside 
      the "safety zone" are immune to being bumped out by an opponent's pawns
    </li>
    <li>Leaving at least one of your pawns near the beginning of the start area will give you an advantage as 
      it is an optimal position to go back to the "safety zone" if any danger were to occur
    </li>
    <li>Ensure that your pawn's do not end up near your opponent's start square as there are many chances where
      the opponent is able to "bump" your pawn to the start again
    </li>
    <li>Finally, stay alert and have fun while playing this game!</li>
  </ol>
  <p>With these tips, you will be well on your way to becoming a <i>Sorry!</i> game champion</p>
